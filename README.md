Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains medical data for 768 female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and older. The dataset includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/mL)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes
